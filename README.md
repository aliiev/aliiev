# Hello world ðŸ‘‹ 
### My name is Akhtem and I'm a web-developer
I have been studying IT for more than 3 years, including web development and programming. Started with developing simple pages and components, but also mastered the development of full-stack web applications. When developing the front-end, I use the latest technologies and take into account the main dimensions of devices for adaptive layout.

In addition to web development, I am fond of programming, including microcontrollers - as a hobby and recreation. In this area, my achievement was the development of a smart home system based on the Arduino microcontroller as a web server, and a web application for interacting with this server, written in React.

### Looking for a job
  
I develop responsive landing pages. Developed projects can be seen in the pinned repositories. I donâ€™t have any commercial work experience yet, but I have more than 3 years of development experience
